# Derived Docs (Do Not Drift)

These documents are **derived views** of the single source of truth:

Rules:
- If you change behavior/requirements, update the spec first.
- These docs should only summarize/extract and add implementation checklists.

Index:
- [Security](SECURITY.md)
- [WHMCS Integration](WHMCS.md)
- [WHMCS SSO Contract](WHMCS_SSO_CONTRACT.md)
- [Migrations](MIGRATIONS.md)
